### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Thiago Ferraz ;). As a seasoned Senior Software Engineer with 15+ years of experience, I've gained extensive knowledge in software development and team management. Java (EJB, JPA, Spring, REST APIs) and JavaScript (React, NodeJS) are my bread and butter, and my education in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering sets a solid foundation for my work.

I take pride in delivering high-quality software on time and on budget, including successful systems integration and web application development projects. I'm passionate about test-driven development, and I believe that clean code is key to successful projects. My knack for algorithms has helped me tackle complex problems with ease.

As a team player, I enjoy collaborating with others and fostering a fun, inclusive work environment. I've successfully led agile development teams to project completion, and I'm always up for learning new technologies and skills.

In addition to my native-level fluency in Portuguese and professional proficiency in English, I'm committed to continuous learning and growth. Let's create something amazing together! ;)

My technical skills include proficiency in programming languages such as Java (5+ years), JavaScript (2+ years), and C (1+ years). I am also well-versed in web technologies such as Java EE, JSF, EJB, JPA (Hibernate) (3+ years), RESTful APIs (3+ years), React (1+ years), Spring Boot (1+ years), and NodeJS (1+ years). In addition, I have expertise in web servers and databases such as Tomcat, WebLogic (2+ years), JBoss (1+ years), MySQL, Oracle (2+ years), and PostgreSQL (1+ years).

I'm an active open source contributor, author of some open source projects like the [agile checklist ](https://github.com/thiagoferrax/agile-checklist), [my-office](https://github.com/thiagoferrax/my-office)...

I also love to contribute on other various projects. 

Feel free to check my GitHub activity.

Thank you
