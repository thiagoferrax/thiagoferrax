### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Thiago Ferraz, I'm a Sernior Software Engineer with 15+ years of experience, including developing web applications, and systems integration projects, and leading teams using agile frameworks.

I'm an active open source contributor, author of some open source projects like the [agile checklist ](https://github.com/thiagoferrax/agile-checklist), [my-office](https://github.com/thiagoferrax/my-office)...

I also love to contribute on other various projects. 

Feel free to check my GitHub activity.

Thank you
